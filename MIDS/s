Assignment 3: Write a program to recognize a document is positive or negative based on polarity
words using suitable classification method.

Assignment 5: We have given a collection of 8 points.
P1=[0.1,0.6]
P2=[0.15,0.71]

P4=[0.16, 0.85]
P5=[0.2,0.3]
P6=[0.25,0.5]
P7=[0.24,0.1]
P8=[0.3,0.2]
Perform the k-mean clustering with initial centroids as m1=P1 =Cluster#1=C1 and
m2=P8=cluster#2=C2.
Answer the following
